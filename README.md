# LandingEllipseSim

This repository contains the data presented at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference in August, 2023. A link to the paper will be provided when the conference proceedings become available in the public domain. The file EllipseDataTable.xlsx contains the data that was produced for the paper. The data is presented in the following format:

Column 1: Re-entry velocity (magnitude), in km/s <br>
Column 2: Re-entry flight path angle (defined as positive below the horizon), in deg <br>
Column 3: Ballistic coefficient of the re-entry body, in kg/m^2 <br>
Column 4: Re-entry heading (defined as 0 due east and positive in the counterclockwise direction), in deg <br>
Column 5: Re-entry latitude, in deg <br>
Column 6: Landing ellipse semimajor axis, in km <br>
Column 7: Landing ellipse semiminor axis, in km <br>
Column 8: Latitude of the center of the landing ellipse, in deg <br>
Column 9: Orientation of the landing ellipse (defined as 0 due east and positive in the counterclockwise direction), in deg <br>
Column 10: Change in longitude from re-entry to landing, in deg <br>

This repository and data set will be updated as more data becomes available.
